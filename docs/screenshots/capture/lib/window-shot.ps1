.SYNOPSIS
  Capture one top-level window to a PNG at true device resolution.

.DESCRIPTION
  The shared Windows half of the screenshot capture recipes in ../. Every per-frame
  script calls this rather than open-coding a capture, so the Windows documentation
  frames cannot drift in DPI handling or cropping.

  Two things this gets right that a naive capture does not:

  * DPI. PowerShell launches DPI-unaware, so GetWindowRect over a per-monitor-aware
    window returns coordinates divided by the monitor scale -- a 454px window reads
    back 303px and captures blurred and short. The thread is made PerMonitorV2 aware
    before any geometry call.
  * The invisible border. On Windows 10/11 GetWindowRect on a decorated window
    includes roughly 7px of transparent resize margin on three sides. The visible
    frame is DwmGetWindowAttribute(DWMWA_EXTENDED_FRAME_BOUNDS), which is what
    -Method Screen crops to.

.PARAMETER Method
  PrintWindow -- asks the window to render itself, so it works while occluded or
  behind another window, and never captures a foreign window that happens to be on
  top. This is the default and the right choice for the widget.

  Screen -- reads the pixels off the desktop after raising the window. Slower and
  it requires an unobstructed desktop, but it is the only way to capture native
  window chrome (title bar, rounded corners, drop shadow) as the user sees it, and
  a WebView2 window under a decorated frame renders more faithfully this way.

.PARAMETER Popup
  The target is a popup menu (class #32768, opened by TrackPopupMenu) rather than a
  window that can hold focus. Alpha only, and it changes two things. The raise is
  skipped: a popup never becomes the foreground window, and the ALT press that
  earns foreground rights would dismiss the menu outright. And the backdrops are
  shown without activation, because a menu's modal loop ends the moment anything
  else is activated -- so the capture would photograph two empty backdrops.

  window-shot.ps1 -ProcessName claude-code-dashboard -Title 'Work intensity' -Method Screen -Out shot.png
